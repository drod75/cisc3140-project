## What is it?

Our project for Computer Science 3140 Design and Implementation of Large Scale Applications aims to create a finance tracker that aims to help users keep track of their finances and present them with advanced graphs for their every day use and analysis. Along with this we want users to get AI generated financial advice 
backed by legitimate financial data so users can make better financial decisions. We aim to give users a 
tool that is simple and easy to use and can help them make better financial decisions, and improve their lives by allowing them to budget better, thank you and enjoy our project!

## How does it work?

Our app first prompts users to login or register, after you register for the first time your userdata is stored in supabase via the cloud, once this happens you can log in and start using our app! Once you
log in you will be presented with your dashboard, there will be nothing at first so you can head to the 
transaction logging page and log your transactions! Your transaction data will be kept in supabase also and you can go back to your dashboard to view them and view graphs. Along with this there is our AI Page where
our AI system will present you with recommendations based on your transactions which will be backed by legitimate financial data. Below is a graph that shows you how it works:
